## Design Process

### 1. Wireframing
Created low-fidelity wireframes focusing on:
- Homepage layout and navigation
- Product listing and detail pages
- Shopping cart and checkout flow
- Mobile navigation patterns

### 2. Prototyping
Built interactive prototypes in Figma for:
- User testing sessions
- Stakeholder reviews
- Development handoff

### 3. User Testing
Conducted 3 rounds of usability testing:
- Round 1: Wireframe testing (5 users)
- Round 2: High-fidelity prototype testing (8 users)
- Round 3: Beta version testing (12 users)

## Key Design Decisions
