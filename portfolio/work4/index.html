         <h1>Case study: NGO website re-design</h1>
         <p>Proud Indian are a non-profit organization who focus on low-income communities, creating small scale business models to create a self-sustaining society. I was tasked with redesigning their website by re-organizing it and give it a more modern feel.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/Cover-CROPPED.png" alt="PICover"></p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>I determined the objectives of the website as the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To ensure the users learn about the goals/activities of the NGO so they can decide whether they want to contribute</li>
<li>To create a simple process to contribute to the NGO by volunteering or donating.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<h4 id="analysis-of-existing-website">Analysis of existing website</h4>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/ss1.png" alt="Screenshot of Home"></p>
<p>The Home page does not immediately show any important information. The entire banner is occupied by quotes and do not give any information about the NGO. The mission statement and vision are seen only after scrolling down.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/AboutUsSS.PNG" alt="Screenshot of About us"></p>
<p>The information is improperly organized — the About Us page consisted of the founding story but nothing else. Aside from the mission statement on the homepage there is not much indication of what the NGO does unless the user clicks on ‘Initiatives’. More history can be added</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/GetInvolvedSS.PNG" alt="Screenshot of get involved"></p>
<p>The information at the top of the page of the ‘Get involved’ is not as important as the different volunteering plans, the flow of information needs to be improved.</p>
<h4 id="user-interviews">User interviews</h4>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/DONATIONSS.PNG" alt="Donations SS"></p>
<p>A total of 10 users were interviewed and were asked to use the donation page. All interviewees agreed that the options provided were confusing and when asked if they would prefer to donate a custom amount — the answer was always yes. Furthermore it was observed that reading every single option took a significant amount of time.
I determined that the donation page needed to feature the custom amount more prominently</p>
<h4 id="analysis-of-existing-websites">Analysis of existing websites</h4>
<p>Looking at the donation pages in the websites of other NGOs, I noticed they had preset amounts to make decisions easier for potential donors.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/othersites.PNG" alt="websites1"></p>
<p>Furthermore, I noticed that other websites have a more prominent donate button on the top bar.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/othersites2.PNG" alt="websites"></p>
<p>These design choices considerably improve the user experience of their respective websites so I decided to incorporate them into my design as well.</p>
<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
<p>Before I began making the prototypes, I made some quick sketches of various ideas which came to my head. I kept modifying these ideas until I was satisfied with what I wanted the layout of the website to be.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/sketches.png" alt="Sketches"></p>
<h3 id="high-fidelity-prototypes">High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
<h4 id="home-page">Home Page</h4>
<p>I re-organized the information in the home page by moving the vision and mission statement to the top of the page. The banner was combined with the top bar to give it a more modern look and the donate button was emphasized more.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/Home.png" alt="Home Page"></p>
<h4 id="volunteer-page">Volunteer Page</h4>
<p>For this page, I placed the various volunteering opportunities at the top of the page. I also added the testimonials at the bottom of the page since it is not the most important information on the page.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/Volunteer.png" alt="Volunteer"></p>
<h4 id="our-impact-page">Our Impact Page</h4>
<p>I re-organized the text of the two overarching schemes. I also changed the areas to cards for a modern look. The various solutions are presented in a side-scrolling fashion as opposed to a vertical scrolling so as to save space and to separate them from the rest of the content.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/Impact.png" alt="Our Impact"></p>
<h4 id="about-us-page">About Us Page</h4>
<p>I moved the event photos which were in the Volunteer page to the About Us page</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/AboutUs.png" alt="About Us"></p>
<h4 id="donations-page">Donations Page</h4>
<p>I simplified the donation page to remove the clutter and added the custom amount at the top of the page and put the existing tiers below it as optional plans.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/PI_Site/donate.png" alt="Donations"></p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>This project was one of my first projects which was not a personal one. Although I worked alone, I learnt the importance of communicating with the stakeholders and understanding their requirements and collating it with that of the users. Overall, despite only having 3 weeks I am happy that I was able to deliver the designs to the NGO</p>
